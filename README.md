## Dataset Details:
The Dataset used for building this recommendation engine is mentioned as below: 
- **Dataset used   :** MovieLens dataset
- **Download Dataset   :** Download Dataset from these following links 
     - Download MovieLens dataset hosted on Kaggle then use [kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data "Dataset Link")
     - Download MovieLens dataset from its official website then use [GroupLens link](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/ "Dataset Link")
- **Dataset File Format  :** CSV File (Comma-separated values). **NOTE:** Download and save dataset inside input_data folder
- **Types of dataset  :**
     - **The full dataset :** This dataset consists of 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users. Includes tag genome data with         12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags.
          - **NOTE:** We will build a simple Recommendation for movies using The full dataset.
     - **The small dataset :** This dataset comprises of 100,000 ratings and 1,300 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 700 users.
